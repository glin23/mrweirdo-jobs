description: Demo-friendly main entry for Mr. Weirdo Jobs. Trigger when the user types /mrweirdo-jobskill, /Mr-Weirdo-JobSkill, asks to run the Mr. Weirdo job skill, wants the main menu, or wants the live end-to-end resume onboarding and the 「跑 N 个」 find-score-apply run (no job list; 3-line report). This is an alias/wrapper over mrweirdo-onboard; do not use for single URL applications.

# Mr. Weirdo JobSkill

This is the user-facing live demo entrypoint. It routes to the same production
workflow as `mrweirdo-onboard`; the point is a clearer command name and smoother
first-run wording, not a separate code path.

If invoked with no concrete request yet, show a single AskUserQuestion main menu
with exactly five choices. Do not show slash commands or ATS platform commands
in the menu.

```text
开始找实习 / Onboard（推荐）：进入完整 onboard 流程，简历 intake -> 说「跑 N 个」-> 现找现投 -> 3 行报告
进度跟踪 / Tracker：记录 OA、面试、拒信、offer 等进展
扩充写作画像 / Expand：从 documents/ 扩充写作画像
技能提升 / Upskill：汇总技能缺口并生成学习建议
起草申请材料 / Materials：为指定岗位起草 cover letter/essay 材料
```

Route the selected option internally to the matching skill. The Onboard choice
continues directly into `mrweirdo-onboard`; do not ask the user to type another
command.

When the user wants the full run, follow
`.claude/skills/mrweirdo-onboard/SKILL.md` exactly, with these demo-facing
defaults:

- Say the product command is `/mrweirdo-jobskill`.
- Keep the first prompt to one intake message: resume PDF path is required;
  one or two sentences of self-introduction are optional.
- Ask the three hard-boundary questions in one UI call, then use the parse soft
  window rather than a separate parse hard gate.
- A run is started by the user saying "跑 N 个": N is how many to apply to,
  capped by today's tier. There is no queue to process and no list to approve.
- Stable unattended batch platforms are Greenhouse and Ashby. Lever remains a
  manual/single-URL helper until its batch upload path is proven reliable.
- If the user is doing a public/live demo, run `npm run demo:check` first and
  fix FAIL rows before continuing. WARN rows are allowed only when they are
  normal first-run onboarding warnings, such as missing profile/search files.
- Proceed through the run (start → find/score/apply batches → finish), show
  the 3-line report, then the missing-info questions if any. Do not stop at a
  plan, and do not show a job list before applying.

Do not route single URLs here. Send one-off applications to the dedicated ATS
skill internally. Do not add career-ops-style keyword routing that guesses
"JD vs command" from generic responsibility text.
