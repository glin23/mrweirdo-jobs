# Job Fit Scorer — Inline Scoring Prompt (v2)

> **Used by**: `.claude/skills/mrweirdo-onboard/SKILL.md` (and any future re-score skill).
> The main agent session reads this as part of the SKILL.md flow and applies it to a batch of jobs in one turn. No separate API call.

You are scoring how well a specific job listing matches the user's **search_intent** (derived from their resume). Output strict JSON per the schema below — one object per job.

---

## Inputs you have in context

1. **`search_intent.json`** — the user's AI-derived job-search intent. Keys to use:
   - `user_summary.field_of_study`, `user_summary.school`, `user_summary.education_level`, `user_summary.year_or_status`, `user_summary.work_authorization`, `user_summary.needs_sponsorship`
   - `search_intent.role_categories[]` (each has `title_pattern`, `priority`, `rationale`) — what the user is looking for
   - `search_intent.industry_targets[]`
   - `search_intent.function_area` (may be null)
   - `search_intent.target_function_anchor` when present — the user's self-reported target functions, resume-supported functions, adjacent functions, and explicitly excluded functions
   - `search_intent.exclude_role_keywords[]` — titles that should kill the score
   - `search_intent.geographic_preference` (`primary_country`, `preferred_metros`, `remote_acceptable`)
   - `search_intent.seniority` (`intern` / `part_time` / `new_grad_FT` / `intern_or_part_time` / `both`)
   - `search_intent.role_type_targets` when present, e.g. `["intern", "part_time"]`
   - `search_intent.caliber_signals.competitive_strengths[]` and `growth_areas[]` — calibrate which-tier-of-company is realistic for this user

2. **Recent skip feedback** (last 20 entries from `~/.mrweirdo-jobs/feedback.jsonl`) — patterns the user has already rejected. **Don't recommend more of the same.** Inject the gist of these into your reasoning.

3. **A batch of jobs to score** — each with `company`, `title`, `location`, `description` (truncated), `source` (e.g. `remoteok`), `apply_url`, and the platform.

## Output — strict JSON per job

For each job in the batch, output one object in this exact shape (no preamble, no markdown fence):

```json
{
  "apply_url": "https://...",
  "fit_score": 7,
  "role_type_match": "intern",
  "recommended": true,
  "legitimacy": "high",
  "legitimacy_signals": ["specific JD with current season", "credible ATS URL"],
  "dim_scores": {
    "role_fit": 8,
    "skills_match": 7,
    "location_fit": 9,
    "visa_compatible": 8,
    "seniority_match": 9,
    "exclude_check": 10
  },
  "key_alignment": ["..."],
  "key_gaps": ["..."],
  "honest_reason": "1-2 sentence summary."
}
```

Return the whole batch as a JSON array `[ {...}, {...}, ... ]`.

## Field rules

- `apply_url` — copy verbatim from input. Used to join scores back to the DB row.
- `fit_score` — integer 0–10.
- `role_type_match` — one of `"intern"`, `"part_time"`, `"new_grad_FT"`, `"other"`. Derive from job title + description versus `search_intent.role_type_targets` / `search_intent.seniority`. `new_grad_FT` = a full-time role a new graduate can take: not a senior title (Senior / Sr. / Staff / Principal / Lead / Director / Head / VP / Chief), and the JD does not require 3 or more years of experience ("X Manager" titles such as Community / Field Marketing Manager can be `new_grad_FT`). The title does NOT need to say "New Grad". Contract / temporary roles are `other`.
- `recommended` — boolean. **True iff every `dim_scores` value is ≥ 5 AND `fit_score` ≥ 5.** (Recall-first calibration; downstream dedupe/quota/platform guards still apply.)
- `legitimacy` — one of `"high"`, `"caution"`, `"suspicious"`. This is a ghost-job / stale-posting signal, not a fit score. Do not adjust `fit_score` or `recommended` because of this field.
- `legitimacy_signals` — 0-2 short factual signals from the provided batch data only. Use wording like `"title mentions 2025"`, `"description is specific about team/projects"`, `"salary range is transparent"`, or `"very generic description"`. Do not claim a job is fake.
- `dim_scores` — all six keys required, each integer 0–10:
  - **role_fit**: does the role description match the user's `search_intent.role_categories` + `industry_targets` + `function_area` + `target_function_anchor`? Anchor this on the user's self-reported target functions first, then resume-supported evidence. High if the role is a direct target-function match; medium if clearly adjacent; low if unrelated or cross-functional. Do not use major alone to pull the user into or out of a function.
  - **skills_match**: overlap between user resume's skills/projects and the JD's stated requirements.
  - **location_fit**: 10 if remote and `geographic_preference.remote_acceptable`; 8–10 if location matches a `preferred_metros` entry; 5–7 if same country (`primary_country`) but unfamiliar metro; 0–3 if outside `primary_country`.
  - **visa_compatible**: 10 if explicitly says "no sponsorship needed" matches user (`needs_sponsorship == false`) OR "sponsors visa" matches user (`needs_sponsorship == true`); 5 if not mentioned (default unknown); 0–2 if JD says "no sponsorship" and user needs it.
  - **seniority_match**: 10 if `role_type_match` is in `search_intent.role_type_targets`; if that array is absent, 10 when `role_type_match == search_intent.seniority` OR `search_intent.seniority == "both"`, 4–6 if adjacent, 0–2 if clearly outside the user's target type.
  - **exclude_check**: 10 if title contains NO `search_intent.exclude_role_keywords[]` (case-insensitive whole-word match); 0 if any exclude keyword matched. **Binary.**
- `key_alignment` — 1–3 concrete short strings: specific reasons the user is well-matched. Reference actual things from resume/intent. ❌ "good fit"  ✅ "Marketing concentration + 2 prior brand internships align with brand-marketing intern title".
- `key_gaps` — 1–3 concrete short strings: specific reasons it might not be a fit. ❌ "some skills missing"  ✅ "JD requires SQL + Tableau; user resume only mentions Excel".
- `honest_reason` — 1–2 sentence overall summary. Match the score — don't be flattering when score is low.

## Hard exclusions (force score down)

These override scoring rubrics:

- **Exclude keyword match**: any of `search_intent.exclude_role_keywords` appears as a whole word in the job title → set `exclude_check = 0`, subtract 5 from `fit_score`, set `recommended = false`. **This is a hard block.** Example: a marketing student's intent has `"software engineer"` in excludes; if title is "Software Engineer Intern", drop the score.
- **Function-distance hard miss**: if the job is outside the user's target-function anchor and not clearly adjacent, set `role_fit ≤ 3`, `fit_score ≤ 4`, and `recommended = false`, even if the company, location, or generic student seniority looks attractive. Examples: an Operations/PM target should not recommend Software Engineer, Nursing, Design, or Data roles; a SWE target should not recommend Marketing, Accounting, Nursing, Design, or Consulting roles unless the user's explicit target functions include them. Adjacent is allowed; cross-functional drift is not.
- **Requested role-type mismatch**: if `search_intent.role_type_targets` exists and `role_type_match` is not in it, this is a hard role-type miss. Set `seniority_match ≤ 2` (NOT 10 — a full-time role is not a seniority match for an intern-only seeker, even if the work is relevant), set `fit_score ≤ 4`, and set `recommended = false`. If `role_type_targets` is absent, use `search_intent.seniority` with the same rule, except `"both"` allows intern + new-grad. Keep the score honest but low for manual review — never let a mismatched role type read as a strong fit. Worked example of the bug this prevents: a `new_grad_FT` "Associate Project Manager" for a `role_type_targets: ["intern","part_time"]` user must score `seniority_match ≤ 2` and `fit_score ≤ 4`, NOT `seniority_match: 10` / `fit_score: 7`. (A deterministic eligibility gate also blocks these from auto-apply, but the displayed score must still be honest.)
- **Wrong role type**: user wants intern but job is clearly senior FT (e.g. title "Senior Manager"); user wants new_grad_FT but job is internship → `seniority_match ≤ 3`, fit_score reduced accordingly.
- **Recruiter-FOR-students role**: job title is "University Recruiter" / "Campus Recruiter" / "Talent Acquisition Specialist" — this is recruiting people LIKE the user, not a role FOR the user. `fit_score ≤ 2`.
- **Location hard miss**: location explicitly outside `primary_country` (e.g. "Berlin, Germany" when user wants US) AND not remote → `location_fit ≤ 2`, fit_score reduced.

## Caliber calibration

Use `search_intent.caliber_signals` to keep the funnel honest:

- If `caliber_signals.competitive_strengths` is rich (prior FAANG internships, top-tier school, top-tier GPA, published work) → user is competitive for high-tier roles; full score range available.
- If `caliber_signals.growth_areas` includes "first internship search" / "early academic stage" / "no industry experience yet" → cap `fit_score ≤ 8` for FAANG-equivalent positions (the user has real shot but should weigh smaller / friendlier companies higher). For roles at smaller companies / less-prestigious brands, no cap.

---

## Be honest, not generous

The user does NOT review these — they auto-apply when `fit_score ≥ threshold`. **False positives directly translate to wasted applications + potential ATS account flags.** When in doubt between adjacent scores, pick the lower one. When a role is clearly wrong, score it < 4 and let the rule-based gating filter it out.

---

## Legitimacy calibration

Use only information already in the job batch. Do not WebSearch and do not
visit the posting.

- `high`: current-looking title, concrete role/team/responsibility details, credible ATS URL, or enough specificity to treat it as normal.
- `caution`: thin or generic description, unclear timing, stale-looking but not clearly expired, or weak source context.
- `suspicious`: strong stale/ghost signals such as an intern/student title with a past year, extremely generic description plus no concrete team/responsibilities, obvious test/sandbox wording, or conflicting title/date signals.

`suspicious` rows keep their score but are held for manual review downstream.
Phrase signals as observations, e.g. `"title contains 2025"` rather than
`"fake job"`.

## Output discipline

Output ONLY the JSON array. No preamble, no markdown fence, no commentary. Each object's `apply_url` must match an input job's `apply_url` exactly so the SKILL.md driver can join scores back to DB rows.
